# Contributing Guidelines
Your input is amazing! Making contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible is one of the most important side, this includes:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Wanted changes
- New features
- Better documentation
- Fixing of spelling and grammatical issues

## Unwanted changes
- Whitespaces and punctuation changes
- Word changes using synonyms
- Entire rewrites of the project, or parts of the project - unless approved first by a maintainer

## All code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Keep consistency with the current state of the codebase, this includes but is not limited to naming convention, Discord embeds, etc.
3. Format the code of the files you've edited with the **black** formatter.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Commit messages guidelines
This project uses [`Conventional Commits 1.0.0`](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) hence your commit messages **must** follow the same convention or your contributions will be ignored, refused or assigned to another user or maintainer.

It would be more than welcome to keep your contributions as a single commit rather than, for examples, 20 `"fix: Stuff"` commits in-between. You may use multiple commmits if you believe the changes made in these commmits have nothing, or close to nothing, in common - feel free to ask a maintainer on whether or not it should be a single commit or not.

## Create a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues) and **then** a pull request
Start contributing by first [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues/new/choose). Once that is done, you can create a pull request for the issue.

## License
Your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/blob/main/LICENSE.md) that covers the project.
